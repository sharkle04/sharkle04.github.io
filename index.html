      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>With 13+ years in Education, I have taught thousands of adults, led professional development workshops online, in-person, and at state and national conferences, developed program-wide curriculum, designed online courses, created a content management system, administered a learning management system, and ran a school that taught English to adults and managed its staff of 28. I look for ways to provide the highest quality educational experiences possible, find technology integral to do so, and harness data to inform and evaluate decisions. I learn new software quickly and have experience in a variety of organizations.</p>
